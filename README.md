# Ruby Production Breakpoints

This is the start of a gem to enable "production breakpoints" in Ruby.

This Gem is a hack days project idea meant to power a prototype, and not actually suitable for production use (yet).

# What this does

This gem lets you dynamically add "production breakpoints" to a live, running application to see what it is doing.

Once you're done debugging, the breakpoints can be unloaded and removed.

# How to use this

This is in early phases of development, but the [architecture doc](./docs/architecture.md) is a good place to get started.

// FIXME  show basic usage in README once stable
